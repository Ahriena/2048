Press T for new game.
Arrow keys to move.

Press space to run the AI.

AI:
  * Highly advanced AI that looks 3 moves into the future and prioritizes scenarios where the highest score is in the top left corner. That's.... that's it.
  * It somehow gets 2048 about half the time. Which was my goal. I moved onto other projects because this was a success, not because my attempts at improving it further blew up in my face and nobody can prove otherwise.
